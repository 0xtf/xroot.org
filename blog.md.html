           For when [280 characters](https://twitter.com/0xtf) is not enough


Welcome to my personal homepage. **xroot.org** has been around for almost 15 years and it now [lives](https://github.com/0xtf/xroot.org) as a simple weblog running with [Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/), which I think is really cool and you should definitely check it out.

You can reach to me on Twitter ([@0xtf](https://twitter.com/0xtf)) or e-mail me at the same handle **@3coresec.com**.
