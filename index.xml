      <description>Recently I wrote about how I don‚Äôt feel confident using Canonical‚Äôs Landscape and how my particular use case, where Landscape was my only means of accessing certain servers after they were deployed, made for an interesting challenge on how to tackle this self imposed limitation while keeping our operational goals in place.
When designing a solution to address connectivity to remote/edge computers obviously our good old VPN will be the first go-to tool.</description>

      <description>Much can be said about evaluations and how the market perceives a certain company. That being said, there is absolutely nothing that justifies or explains something like this:
 That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the post.</description>

      <description>For the past 2 years I‚Äôve relied on Canonical Landscape extensively. In this post I‚Äôll summarize my experience with the platform as well as share some important lessons I learned for anyone running mission-critical applications in which Landscape plays a part of the workflow.
For anyone that isn‚Äôt familiar with the software, Landscape is Canonical‚Äôs SaaS offer to maintain a fleet of Ubuntu servers. From keeping track of USNs, package and user status, to performance and overall maintenance of the servers.</description>

      <description>Recently I decided it was time to not only take a break but instead fully departure social networks. This is a process that started years ago when I first got rid of other social media services, even though it was only completed when the last standing social network profile came to an end:
The time has come for my last social network presence (Twitter) to come to an end.

      <title>AWS Guardduty vs IDS</title>

      <description>I recently came across an AWS Blog post titled New third-party test compares Amazon GuardDuty to network intrusion detection systems where the author links to a white paper written by, as the title suggest, a third party.
The intent of their article is to provide an unbiased analyses of the capabilities of AWS GuardDuty when compared with &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; network intrusion detection systems. I do not, however, believe this objective was reached, and I want to highlight a few points about it in this blog post.</description>

      <description>3CORESec, which got its name from the &amp;ldquo;three cores&amp;rdquo; that go into our business goals (truth, trust &amp;amp; transparency) is a boutique information security company dedicated to creating managed detection security platforms, products and services.
Officially opened in 2019, 3CORESec, or 3CS for short, started with the idea of making robust information security products more easily accessible as well as developing these products with real-world, enterprise-ready capabilities. With so many products and services built under a lab environment, it&amp;rsquo;s a shame how many good ideas are lost when they face the demanding requirements of enterprises.</description>

      <description>Hi there, welcome! üëãüèΩ
xroot.org is the personal homepage of Tiago Faria (that&amp;rsquo;s me).
I started the website back in 2006 to run a Wordpress blog and in its 15 years of existence I&amp;rsquo;ve changed content and purpose so many times it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep track. With no more presence in social networks, this will be the place I get to call online home.
$ cat about.txt I have around 1000 hobbies even though I only get to put in practice a handful of them.</description>
