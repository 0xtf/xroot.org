 Happy 20th birthday!
Xbox&rsquo;s 20th birthday is a good reminder of the many stories, sleepless nights, friendships and rage quits that I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to experience. From the first time I saw Gears of War (and played for 18 hours straight) to learning about XBMC (that is still a reference in open-source to this day) and being able to have a multimedia player that I could FTP my content to."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2021-11-15T15:42:17+01:00" />

<p>Happy 20th birthday!</p>
<p>Xbox&rsquo;s 20th birthday is a good reminder of the many stories, sleepless nights, friendships and rage quits that I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to experience. From the first time I saw Gears of War (and played for 18 hours straight) to learning about XBMC (that is still a reference in open-source to this day) and being able to have a multimedia player that I could FTP my content to.</p>
<p>I hold the dearest memories of all my experiences with Xbox, which for many, is a lot more than just a gaming console.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to another 20, Xbox! 🍻</p>
