  The first two seasons of this show are, simply put, amazing!
I feel the show took quite a different direction in S03 (technology was no longer the subject pushing the entire show forward). There&rsquo;s a shift towards personal relationships and technology became something that was part of the show, no longer the main subject of it.
By the show finale it definitely felt darker and lost a lot of that feel good aspect that we would get out of watching the protagonists running a modem bank, buying second-hand servers or hearing a dial-up connection being established."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2022-01-10T06:59:17+01:00" />

<p>The first two seasons of this show are, simply put, amazing!</p>
<p>I feel the show took quite a different direction in S03 (technology was no longer the subject pushing the entire show forward). There&rsquo;s a shift towards personal relationships and technology became something that was part of the show, no longer the main subject of it.</p>
<p>By the show finale it definitely felt <em>darker</em> and lost a lot of that <em>feel good</em> aspect that we would get out of watching the protagonists running a modem bank, buying second-hand servers or hearing a dial-up connection being established.</p>
<p>Overall, a very good show that is extremely underrated.</p>
