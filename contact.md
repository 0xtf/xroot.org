# contact information

## Twitter
Quick and easy. [DM's are open](https://twitter.com/0xtf). 

## E-mail 
I love OpenPGP, especially [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/). That being said, e-mail and OpenPGP are hard to set up, and easy to fuck up in OPSEC. Feel free to use it, but if you're unsure of what you're doing, I'd prefer if you reach out via Twitter.

I frequently change keys, so make sure you're using the one listed below.

You can find my current OpenPGP key [here](public-key.txt). It's probably in several key servers but I prefer to have it hosted here as well. If you choose to use key servers, please verify the entire fingerprint.

I have updated my contact information, and I'll no [longer use the email addresses](email.html) I had before.
