# xroot.org

This repository holds the content of xroot.org in an attempt to have a self-sustained Hugo deployment without having to run it locally. The website is built using GitHub Actions (where a recent version of Hugo is downloaded) and publishes to GitHub Pages.

This setup allows me to simply write the posts in Markdown (either locally in my machine or via GitHub's website itself) and the Action will build and publish a new version of the website. 

The Action isn't, by far, a beautiful thing to look at, but it gets the job done.
