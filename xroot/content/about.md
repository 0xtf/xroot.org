Hi there, welcome! 👋🏽

**xroot.org** is the personal homepage of Tiago Faria *(that's me)*. 

I started the website back in 2006 to run a Wordpress blog and in its 15 years of existence I've changed content and purpose so many times it's hard to keep track. I'll use it to post anything > [280 characters](https://twitter.com/0xtf).

I have around 1000 hobbies, even though I only get to put in practice a handful of them. I'm passionate about motorcycle racing and *- even though I don't do it as much as I would like -* I'll try to spend as much time as I possibly can on track. Here's a picture of me in the legendary Estoril *(former Formula 1 and MotoGP)* track:

When I'm not racing, [watching](/tags/watch/) movies or series, obsessing over my book collection or playing [Gears of War](https://gearsofwar.com/), I'll be having fun with my family and *- trying to -* stop my 2 kids from fighting.

Professionally I've been working in information security *(I don't use the c word)* throughout the majority of my career. I've worked in several bank, pharmaceutical and governmental institutions, including a position with [USAFE](https://www.usafe.af.mil/) *(United States Air Force in Europe)* working alongside some cool people at the [65th Communication Squadron](https://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432854/65-communications-squadron-usafe/). 

Even though it existed as a R&D project for much longer, in 2019 I founded <a href="http://3coresec.com/" target="_blank">3CORESec</a>, a company that specializes in the creation of tools and platforms for threat hunting and detection engineering as well as original research. I've written about 3CORESec in its [own separate page](/3coresec).
