I've seen my fair share of bad business decisions or cover ups when it comes to product functionalities but Auth0 is undoubtedly the worst I have ever seen. 

If youâ€™re considering investing your money in Auth0 (in some cases up to thousands of dollars), do yourself a favor and build your own identity server. 

It might seem overkill to spend all that development effort when at first glance Auth0 will do everything you need (even if everything is as simple as basic login + MFA). But trust me, the moment you ACTUALLY start integrating it, you either make peace with the fact you're gonna take a hammer to your code or you go back to the drawing board and pick something else. 

I cannot stress enough just how bad Auth0 is.
