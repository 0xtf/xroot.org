[Halt and Catch Fire - 2014](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/)

{{< youtube pWrioRji60A >}}

The first two seasons of this show are, simply put, amazing! 

I feel the show took quite a different direction in S03 (technology was no longer the subject pushing the entire show forward). There's a shift towards personal relationships and technology became something that was part of the show, no longer the main subject of it. 

By the show finale it definitely felt *darker* and lost a lot of that *feel good* aspect that we would get out of watching the protagonists running a modem bank, buying second-hand servers or hearing a dial-up connection being established. 

Overall, a very good show that is extremely underrated.
