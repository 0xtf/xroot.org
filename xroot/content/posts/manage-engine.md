Manage Engine, or Zoho - whatever they're going by these days - has been showing up in the news regarding critical vulnerabilities in their products, and how they being used by malicious actors. 

I'm surprised Manage Engine is still in business in the first place. Their software is the definition of sausage software: you don't want to see how it's made.

I find it more newsworthy the fact that companies have to rely on shitty software to do the most basic enterprise IT tasks than the vulnerabilities in Zoho's software.

Fun fact: I once spent 12 hours (straight) on a phone call with Manage Engine support to recover an OpsManager installation.
