Happy 20th birthday!

Xbox's 20th birthday is a good reminder of the many stories, sleepless nights, friendships and rage quits that I've been fortunate to experience. From the first time I saw Gears of War (and played for 18 hours straight) to learning about XBMC (that is still a reference in open-source to this day) and being able to have a multimedia player that I could FTP my content to.

I hold the dearest memories of all my experiences with Xbox, which for many, is a lot more than just a gaming console.

Here's to another 20, Xbox! 🍻
