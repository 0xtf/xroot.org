## e-mail / old accounts

For many years I gathered a lot of e-mail addresses. I think I even got to a point where I was collecting them, and the more I could get, the better. Now things have changed, and I'm trying to keep e-mails and general accounts to a minimum.

Because of that, I'll no longer have access to the email address under this domain (xroot.org), as well as the e-mail address from the Ubuntu (ubuntu.com) Project, nor the GNU Project (gnu.org).

I'll be using only one personal e-mail address hosted and maintained by someone else (enough time managing my own). Paying for a service isn't something I consider will bring any additional value either, even though I recommend mailbox.org for that.

Under special situations I'll have a disposable e-mail address that I can provide upon request.
