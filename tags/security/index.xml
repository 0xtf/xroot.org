      <description>Manage Engine, or Zoho - whatever they are going by these days - has been showing up in the news regarding critical vulnerabilities in their products, and how they being used by malicious actors.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Manage Engine is still in business in the first place. Their software is the definition of sausage software: you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see how it&amp;rsquo;s made.
I find it more newsworthy the fact that companies have to rely on shitty software to do the most basic enterprise IT tasks than the vulnerabilities in Zoho&amp;rsquo;s software.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote about how I don‚Äôt feel confident using Canonical‚Äôs Landscape and how my particular use case, where Landscape was my only means of accessing certain servers after they were deployed, made for an interesting challenge on how to tackle this self imposed limitation while keeping our operational goals in place.
When designing a solution to address connectivity to remote/edge computers obviously our good old VPN will be the first go-to tool.</description>
