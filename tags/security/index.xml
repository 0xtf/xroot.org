      <title>Stay away from Trash0 (Auth0)</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of bad business decisions or cover ups when it comes to product functionalities, but Auth0 is undoubtedly the worst I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you‚Äôre considering investing your money in Auth0 (in some cases up to thousands of dollars), do yourself a favor and build your own identity server.
It might seem overkill to spend all that development effort when at first glance Auth0 will do everything you need (even if everything is as simple as basic login + MFA).</description>

      <description>Fuck off!
Putting authentication options at the highest possible plan is just an idiot move, no other way around it.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote about how I don‚Äôt feel confident using Canonical‚Äôs Landscape and how my particular use case, where Landscape was my only means of accessing certain servers after they were deployed, made for an interesting challenge on how to tackle this self imposed limitation while keeping our operational goals in place.
When designing a solution to address connectivity to remote/edge computers obviously our good old VPN will be the first go-to tool.</description>
