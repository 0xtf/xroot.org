      <description>Manage Engine, or Zoho - whatever they are going by these days - has been showing up in the news regarding critical vulnerabilities in their products, and how they being used by malicious actors.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Manage Engine is still in business in the first place. Their software is the definition of sausage software: you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see how it&amp;rsquo;s made.
I find it more newsworthy the fact that companies have to rely on shitty software to do the most basic enterprise IT tasks than the vulnerabilities in Zoho&amp;rsquo;s software.</description>
