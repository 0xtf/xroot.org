      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of bad business decisions or cover ups when it comes to product functionalities, but Auth0 is undoubtedly the worst I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you‚Äôre considering investing your money in Auth0 (in some cases up to thousands of dollars), do yourself a favor and build your own identity server.
It might seem overkill to spend all that development effort when at first glance Auth0 will do everything you need (even if everything is as simple as basic login + MFA).</description>

Putting authentication options at the highest possible plan is just an idiot move, no other way around it.</description>

      <description>For the past 2 years I‚Äôve relied on Canonical Landscape extensively. In this post I‚Äôll summarize my experience with the platform as well as share some important lessons I learned for anyone running mission-critical applications in which Landscape plays a part of the workflow.
For anyone that isn‚Äôt familiar with the software, Landscape is Canonical‚Äôs SaaS offer to maintain a fleet of Ubuntu servers. From keeping track of USNs, package and user status, to performance and overall maintenance of the servers.</description>
