title: xroot.org new life
---

For the past couple of months I've been going back and forward on my decision to keep anything under xroot.org. Even though it's not much, I've migrated everything _(yes, even the bad looks of it)_ to Jekyll and I'm quite happy with the result. 

Hopefully with the inclusion of a few more functionalities _(and how easy it is to update)_, I'll give it a better use.
