## Primary Key

The key mentioned on the [contact page](contact.html) is my primary key, for every day use. It's considered safe, since I go to great lengths to make sure it is kept that way. The key is also the one I use for [key signing](signing-policy.html).

## Secondary Key

Offline key available by request.
