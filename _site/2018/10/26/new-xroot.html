<h2>xroot.org new life</h2>

<p>For the past couple of months I’ve been going back and forward on my decision to keep anything under xroot.org. Even though it’s not much, I’ve migrated everything <em>(yes, even the bad looks of it)</em> to Jekyll and I’m quite happy with the result.</p>

<p>Hopefully with the inclusion of a few more functionalities <em>(and how easy it is to update)</em>, I’ll give it a better use.</p>
