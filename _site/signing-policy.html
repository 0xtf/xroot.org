<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This policy is valid for all signatures made by the key on the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>I live in Lisbon (Portugal) and I’m available to sign keys at any time (really!). If you live in Lisbon or if you’re passing by, I encourage you to contact me so we can arrange a meeting.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-for-signing">Prerequisites for signing</h2>
<p>The signee (the key owner who wishes to obtain a signature to his/her key from me) must have an easy way of sharing his/her public key. I do not require the key to be available on a Key Server, even though it’s encouraged. I don’t mind fetching the key from a private location, such as a homepage.</p>

<p>The signee must be able to prove his/her identify by a way of a valid identity card and valid driving license. Both these documents must contain a picture of the signee.</p>

<p>The signee must have his/her OpenPGP key fingerprint printed on a piece of paper or card. I personally use <a href="http://moo.com/">Moo Cards</a>. The fingerprint is the output of the following command (or equivalent if not a user of GnuPG):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gpg --fingerprint 0x12345678
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The signee must be patient and understand that the whole process of signing a key takes some time.</p>

<h2 id="the-act-of-signing">The act of signing</h2>
<p>After having received (or exchanged) the proof detailed in the above, I will sign the sheet of paper myself to avoid a fraud.</p>

<p>When at home, I will sign the key and upload it to an SKS Key Server, unless I didn’t fetch the key from a Key Server or if asked not to. If that’s the case, I’ll send separate signatures of each UID, on a encrypted e-mail message, to the corresponding e-mail addresses (unless they’re Level 2 signature).</p>

<p>The levels of signatures are described below.</p>

<h2 id="level-of-signatures">Level of signatures</h2>

<p>The levels of signatures, as described on <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.1">RFC 4880, Section 5.2.1 - Signature Types</a>, used by my signatures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 2 - Given to sign-only keys. Usually their UIDs are of the type “Firstname Lastname” and not “Firstname Lastname <a href="mailto:user@mailaddress.invalid">user@mailaddress.invalid</a>” which means that I can’t (automatically) send verification mails to them.</li>
  <li>Level 3 - Given to sign-and-encrypt keys, which pass all the checks: I have met the signee, I have verified his/her identity card and fingerprint.</li>
</ul>
