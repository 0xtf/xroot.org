				<p>Hi there, welcome! üëãüèΩ</p>
<p><strong>xroot.org</strong> is the personal homepage of Tiago Faria <em>(that&rsquo;s me)</em>.</p>
<p>I started the website back in 2006 to run a Wordpress blog and in its 15 years of existence I&rsquo;ve changed content and purpose so many times it&rsquo;s hard to keep track. For now I believe I settled with a workflow that serves my purposes, which is to have a simple blog and a place to call <em>- online -</em> home.</p>
<h2 id="-cat-tiagotxt">$ cat tiago.txt</h2>
<p>I have around 1000 hobbies even though I only get to put in practice a handful of them. I&rsquo;m passionate about motorcycle racing and <em>- even though I don&rsquo;t do it as much as I would like -</em> I&rsquo;ll try to spend as much time as I possibly can on track. Here&rsquo;s a picture of me in the legendary Estoril <em>(former Formula 1 and MotoGP)</em> track:</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not racing, obsessing over my book collection or playing <a href="https://gearsofwar.com/">Gears of War</a>, I&rsquo;ll be having fun with my family and <em>- trying to -</em> stop my 2 kids from fighting.</p>

<p>Professionally I&rsquo;ve been working in information security <em>(I don&rsquo;t use the c word)</em> throughout the majority of my career. I&rsquo;ve worked in several bank, pharmaceutical and governmental institutions, including a very insightful position with <a href="https://www.usafe.af.mil/">USAFE</a> <em>(United States Air Force in Europe)</em> working alongside some cool people at the <a href="https://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/432854/65-communications-squadron-usafe/">65th Communication Squadron</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it existed as a R&amp;D project for much longer, in 2019 I founded <a href="https://3coresec.com">3CORESec</a>, a company that specializes in the creation of tools and platforms for threat hunting and detection engineering. I&rsquo;ve written about 3CORESec in its <a href="/3coresec">own separate page</a>.</p>
